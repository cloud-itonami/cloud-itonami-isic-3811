  "Phase 0→3 staged rollout — this actor's analog of robotaxi's ODD phases
  and `cloud-itonami-isic-6311`/`cloud-itonami-isic-7820`'s rollout phases:
  start narrow (read-only), widen as trust grows. Where the
  WasteDispatchGovernor answers 'is this allowed?', the phase answers 'how
  much autonomy does the actor have *yet*?'. It can only ever make the
  actor MORE conservative than the governor: it downgrades a
  governor-clean commit to approval or hold, never the reverse.

    Phase 0  read-only          — no writes at all. `:report/query` only
                                  (still governor-gated).
    Phase 1  assisted-pickup    — `:pickup/schedule` allowed, every
                                  schedule needs human approval.
    Phase 2  + manifest/dispute — adds `:manifest/record` and
                                  `:dispute/request` (still approval-only).
    Phase 3  supervised auto    — governor-clean, high-confidence
                                  `:pickup/schedule`/`:manifest/record`
                                  may auto-commit.

  `:dispute/request` is deliberately NEVER a member of any phase's `:auto`
  set, at any phase — a generator/facility dispute always reaches a human,
  independent of the WasteDispatchGovernor's own always-escalate check on
  the same op.

  `gate` runs AFTER `policy/check`, taking the governor disposition
  (:commit | :escalate | :hold) and returning the phase-adjusted disposition
  plus a reason when the phase changed it.")

  by any ordinary caller that simply omits :phase — not just malformed/
  malicious input — so it must be the MOST CONSERVATIVE phase, never the
  most permissive (the same fail-open shape found and fixed this session
  in the `cloud-itonami-isic-6311`/`cloud-itonami-isic-7820`/
  `gftd-talent-actor` sibling templates: a caller who forgets :phase must
  never silently get maximum autonomy). `:dispute/request` is unaffected
  either way — never in any phase's `:auto` set."

  - a write op not yet enabled in this phase → HOLD (:phase-disabled).
  - a write op enabled but not auto-eligible → ESCALATE (:phase-approval),
    even if the governor was clean. `:dispute/request` is never
    auto-eligible at any phase, so it always lands here once phase ≥ 2."
